# Lynch Library

This project aims to catalog information about [Lynch syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynch_syndrome), also known as DNA mismatch repair deficiency. This project is entirely AI generated.

## Contributing

When contributing, run `git commit -a --amend` to avoid adding temporary local files and keep the git commit log meaningful and navigable (avoid many small commits, and especially intermediate breakage).

See `TODO.md` for development roadmap.
